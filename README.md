#Movie Tools

Some random tools I use to help my movie encoding endeavors.

I am not sure how useful this may be to anyone else, but it should be good for a laugh at my lazy C# coding style.

## MovieInfo

This program scans the movie library on my server and generates a .csv file so I can track various movie attributes.

## AudioRenamer

Calculates the bitrate of audio tracks dropped onto the UI.

This lets you quickly get bitrates for the lossless audio tracks after extracting them with eac3to.
Remember to put the runtime of the movie into the program _before_ dropping the audio tracks.
